                Past initiatives include the development of an electroadhesive climbing robot for the Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX V), and our Glacial Analog Project, where we conduct fieldwork on the Athabasca Glacier to collect water samples and simulate extraterrestrial environments. Weâ€™re also collaborating with Rockaboo Mountain Adventures and Parks Canada to design a net-zero mobile research lab that supports sustainable field science.

                Our latest project focuses on building a custom bioreactor to study how cyanobacteria behaves in microgravity, as part of the CAN-RGX VIII challenge. By investigating its growth and survival in space-like conditions, we aim to contribute to future life-support systems and closed-loop habitats for long-duration missions.
